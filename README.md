# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

Hi, Iâ€™m Maryam â€” a tech professional with a background in Linux system administration, data analysis, and software development. I currently work as a data analyst at LinkedIn, where I support onboarding initiatives that improve the employee experience and boost operational efficiency. Iâ€™m RHCSA-certified and studying for my CompTIA Security+ certification, with a growing focus on cybersecurity and SOC roles. Iâ€™m also working toward my degree in Computer Information Systems, gaining both academic and hands-on experience across multiple areas of tech.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, trying new recipes, and staying connected to my West African roots. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and creativity â€” whether Iâ€™m securing a system, building something meaningful, or bringing people together over a homemade meal. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking for someone with grit, curiosity, and a proven ability to learn and deliver.
